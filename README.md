# Time_Delayed_Neural_Network_Project_MATLAB

**Implementing an Incremental Training Algorithm for Time-Delayed Neural Networks with MATLAB**

This project was part of my Data Science MSc. The task was to take a TDNN (for financial predictions) with offline (batch) learning and adapt the code in order to use online (incremental) learning. The project required two seprate implementations of the online learning algorithm; first using MATLAB's built-in vectorisation operations, and then using for loops only, without any matrix multiplication.
